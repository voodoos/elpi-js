# Elpi-js

This project aims to provide an easy way to use the *Elpi lambda-prolog interpreter* ([homepage here](https://github.com/LPCIC/elpi/)), written in OCaml, in a completely web based setting.

This is done in a three step process :

- The Elpi_api in OCaml is compiled into a web worker using the [js_of_ocaml]() compiler. It creates the `lib/elpi-js.js` file from `.ml` sources in the `src` folder.
- A small API is given to handle the lifecycle of the worker and communicate with it in the `lib/elpi-api.js` file.
- Finally a set of bindings for ReasonML is provided [TODO] for easy use of the api in web oriented projects.

## Node-based project
The project is not yet published to npm, but you can add it to your project via git :
```
yarn add https://github.com/voodoos/elpi-js
```

And then simply use the javascript sources in the `node_modules/elpi-js/lib` folder or ask `bsb`to use the Reason bindings by adding `elpi-js` to `bs-dependencies` in your `bsconfig.json`.

## Usage

Once the `elpi-api.js` file is loaded you can easily create a new Elpi worker by instantiating the `elpi` class with some callback functions for handling the results :
```
function log(l, p, t) { 
      console.log(l, p, t);
}

function answer(arg, ass) {
      console.log(arg, ass);
}

const elp = new Elpi(log, answer);
```

You can then send program to compile to Elpi :
```
elp.compile([{ name: "toto.elpi", 
               content: "world \"hello\". world \"pussycat\"."}]);
```

And query them :
```
elp.queryAll("world A.");
```
